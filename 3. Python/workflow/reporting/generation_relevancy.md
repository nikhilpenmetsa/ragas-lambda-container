## Response Relevancy Metric

This metric assesses how well the generated output addresses and pertains to the user's question or input.

#### Examples of High Response Relevancy:
(place holder examples)
- Question: "What are the basic ingredients needed to make a classic chocolate chip cookie?"
- Retrieved document: "To make classic chocolate chip cookies, you'll need all-purpose flour, butter, white and brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips."
- Generated response: "The basic ingredients for classic chocolate chip cookies are all-purpose flour, butter, white and brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips."

##### Examples of Low Response Relevancy:
(place holder examples)
- Question: "What are the basic ingredients needed to make a classic chocolate chip cookie?"
- Retrieved document: "Cookies are a type of sweet treat enjoyed around the world. They come in many varieties, including chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and sugar cookies."
- Generated response: "Cookies are popular sweet treats that come in many varieties. Some popular types include chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and sugar cookies. They are enjoyed in many countries around the world."

## Causes of Low Response Relevancy
(place holder examples)
- Poor understanding of the user's question or intent
- Irrelevant document retrieval
- Off-topic language model generation
- Overemphasis on tangential information
- Misinterpretation of context or ambiguity in the question
- Lack of focus on the core elements of the query

## Ways to Improve Response Relevancy
(place holder examples)
- Enhance question understanding and intent recognition
- Improve retrieval algorithms to fetch more relevant documents
- Implement answer extraction techniques to focus on pertinent information
- Use query expansion to better capture the user's intent
- Incorporate relevance scoring in the response generation process
- Fine-tune the language model on task-specific datasets
- Implement post-processing steps to ensure the response directly addresses the question
- Develop better prompting techniques to guide the model towards relevant responses
