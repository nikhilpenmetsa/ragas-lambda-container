## Context Precision Metric
This metric measures how much of the retrieved context is actually relevant and used in generating the response to the user's question.

#### Examples of High Context Precision:
(place holder examples)
- Question: "What is the boiling point of water?"
- Retrieved context: "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level. The boiling point can vary slightly based on atmospheric pressure."
- Generated response: "The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level."

#### Examples of Low Context Precision:
(place holder examples)
- Question: "What is the boiling point of water?"
- Retrieved context: "Water is a chemical compound with the formula H2O. It is essential for all known forms of life. Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans. The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius at sea level."
- Generated response: "The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius at sea level."

#### Causes of Low Context Precision
(place holder examples)
- Over-retrieval of irrelevant information
- Lack of focus in the retrieval process
- Inclusion of tangential or unnecessary details in the context
- Poor filtering of retrieved documents
- Ineffective ranking of relevant information

#### Ways to Improve Context Precision
(place holder examples)
- Implement better document ranking algorithms
- Use more specific queries for retrieval
- Employ semantic similarity measures to filter relevant information
- Implement passage retrieval instead of full document retrieval
- Use query-focused summarization techniques
- Fine-tune retrieval models on domain-specific data
- Implement post-retrieval filtering based on relevance scores
